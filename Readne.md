### My name is Ansuman Pal 
and this is my DSA project from cipher schools 
So we made a dice game using classes and methods in cpp 
It's made to be played in the terminal with a history feature 

So i made two dice games the original one being the direct one given by our teacher 
And the second one is my own version of the game where i tried to improve on the base game;
